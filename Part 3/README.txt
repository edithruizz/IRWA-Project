	This document provides detailed instructions on how to run the Part 3 of our IRWA project.

	- How to run the code
	
	This code is written in python hence it must be executed in any pyhton-supported workframes. As a reference, we have done our
	project in Google Colaboratory and we encourage you to do as well.

	Our project is based on the following files of data: Rus_Ukr_war_data_ids.csv, Rus_Ukr_war_data.json, Evaluation_gt.csv and Truth_gt.csv.
	You will need the documents and their paths in order to execute the code.

	As said before, we did our project on Google Colab and therefore mounted our drive account at the beginning of the code to access
	all necessary files. Make sure you mount your drive account before running everything, or simply check that the paths of the csv 
	and json files match with your folder distribution.

	The code is divided in three sections, TF-IDF + cosine similarity, Our Score + cosine similarity and finally Word2vec + cosine similarity.
  No code modifications need to be done, just make sure you execute the cells in order and your paths are correct.
