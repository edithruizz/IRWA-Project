	This document provides detailed instructions on how to run the Part 1 of our IRWA project.

	- How to run the code
	This code is written in python hence it must be executed in any pyhton-supported workframes. As a reference, we have done our
	project in Google Colaboratory and we encourage you to do as well.

	Our project is based on two files of data: Rus_Ukr_war_data_ids.csv and Rus_Ukr_war_data.json, which you will need in order to
	execute.

	As said before, we did our project on Google Colab and therefore mounted our drive account at the beginning of the code to access
	all necessary files. Make sure you mount your drive account before running everything, or simply check that the paths of the csv 
	and json files match with your folder distribution.

	The code is divided in two sections, Text Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis. No code modifications need to be done, just 
	make sure you execute the cells in order and your paths are correct.
